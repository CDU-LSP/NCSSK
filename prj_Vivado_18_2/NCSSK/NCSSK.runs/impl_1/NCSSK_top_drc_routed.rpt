2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
31 out of 32 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: delay_point[6:0], pitch_angle[21:0], sys_rst_n, rom_fft_rst_n.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
31 out of 32 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: delay_point[6:0], pitch_angle[21:0], sys_rst_n, rom_fft_rst_n.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fft_signal_inst/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fft_signal_inst/phase_in_count[1]_i_2/O, cell fft_signal_inst/phase_in_count[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net get_phase_difference_inst/phase_difference_a0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin get_phase_difference_inst/phase_difference_a_b_0[13]_i_1/O, cell get_phase_difference_inst/phase_difference_a_b_0[13]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT fft_signal_inst/phase_in_count[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    get_phase_difference_inst/phase_in_count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    get_phase_difference_inst/phase_in_count_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory

For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (fft_signal_inst/fft_module_inst/U0/i_synth/xfft_inst/non_floating_point.arch_d.xfft_inst/has_bit_reverse.dig_rev_mem/blk_ram.use_bram_only.mem/depths_3to9.ram_loop[0].use_RAMB18.SDP_RAMB18E1_36x512) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
